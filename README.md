Purpose of Multiple Notebooks:
1. News_sentiment_Impact.ipynb : Evaluation of the impact of polarity of news sentiment on "Apple" keyword on Stock Market Close Price using Feature Correlation Map, SelectKbest Features and Feature Importance Permutations.

2. Stock_multivariate_singleday_forecast.ipynb: Here, I will be forecasting the Close price of Next few days using concept of moving window i.e taking few past days and predicting the next day's Close Price using Multivariate Time Series Forecasting.

3. Stock_univariate_forecast.ipynb : Forecasting the Stock Market Price for the upcoming few days at one time using Recurrent Neural Network with LSTM Architecture.

4. Stock_univariate_moving_window.ipynb: Comparing the performance of forecasting time series data using ARIMA and Recurrent Neural Network such as LSTM Architecture. Here, I will be forecasting the Close price of Next few days using concept of moving window i.e taking few past days and predicting the next day's Close Price. Similarly, appending that result into test data to predict next day's Close Price.

5. trade_strategies_AAPL.ipynb: In this Notebook, I will be comparing few signal Indicators for generating Buy and Sell Signals on Historical Close Price.

6. Stock_multivariate_forecast.ipynb : Forecasting the Stock Market Price for the upcoming few days at one time using Multivariate Recurrent Neural Network with LSTM Architecture.
